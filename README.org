Manage your documents with =doc=, powered by trusty old bash.

** Dependencies

Sorry this is so bloaty.

- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/][bash]]
- [[https://git-scm.com/][git]]

** Installing

Just a stinky old Makefile, it's not that hard.

#+begin_src bash
make install
#+end_src

Run it as root, you crazy fool.

#+begin_src bash
sudo make install
#+end_src

Get freaky with symlinks.

#+begin_src bash
make link
#+end_src

All done with it?  No biggie, just uninstall it.

#+begin_src bash
make uninstall
#+end_src

Or quit being such a fancy pants and just use a heckin' alias.

#+begin_src bash
# .bashrc or whatnot
alias doc='~/src/doc/doc'
#+end_src

** Configuration

Set the path to your precious documents.
